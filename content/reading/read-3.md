I think I'm good at recognizing the validity in other points of view. I don't simply mean that I ought to have an open mind and so I choose to respect different opinions. I mean that I can genuinely understand why they think that way. This is perhaps tied to my resistance to adopting any ideology or staying too long in any one camp. Some people would consider this a failing, me being flaky and shallow, unwilling to take a stand. Maybe it is all those things.

Tapping into other people's minds, seeing the world through their eyes, experiencing life the way they do.

My ability to see things through other people's eyes has its limits. I wish I could just read a book and experience it in the same way as others. I wish I could force ideas to resonate with me as they do for others. But something is blocking that.

I mentioned it not being the season for that idea to take root in my mind.

Isis Unveiled. The Brothers Karamozov.  Hadn't even heard of Helena Blavasky before, but was inspired by reading Darwin's biography to read more about Einstein. Isis Unveiled one of his supposed favorite books (because some random website said so, who knows).  Blavasky wasn't something I would have stumbled upon; outside my sphere of habit. Not something I would have had the patience for. But following a random walk through influential books seems more fruitful than mapping out what all I'm going to read ahead of time.  

I'm open to the idea of a non-materialist worldview. But I'm unable to choose what I believe in. Reincarnation. This is probably another failing of mine. The material clockwork world, without design and purpose, just makes sense to me. Even the idea of determinism, or lack of free will, doesn't really bother me. Nondualism.

Some people will view the widespread material world view as progress, but it could just as well be group think. Memetics.
