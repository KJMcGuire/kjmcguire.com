**Priorities.** I've known editors to fixate on the finer points of a style guide while ignoring the bigger problems. Wordy, amateur sentences. Lack of logical flow. Nonsensical paragraphs.
These are harder issues to tackle than just applying the Chicago Manual of Style. I understand how easy it is easy to lapse into editor auto-pilot, to read without thinking, to scan for grammatical accuracy only and conformance to organizational rules. But this is lazy editing. Simply applying a style guide without addressing the underlying meat of a document is like slapping a coat of paint onto a dilapidated house. You need to first replace the rotting beams and fix the cracked foundation. Otherwise you end up with a structure that may look good from a distance but if you look closer, you see that the thing is a mess. Likewise, if a team of subject matter experts cobble together an incoherent and disjointed engineering plan last minute, who cares that they defined an acronym they never used again or placed a colon after "including" before a bullet list? The document itself is unreadable. Sometimes fixing it takes more time than you've been given. That will happen when people underestimate the value a seasoned technical writer brings, thinking we're just proofreaders. 


**Mindless adherence to alleged writing rules.** There are many of these in American English: you must never end a sentence with a preposition, you should eliminate the word "that" ... The one that vexes me the most is the ban on passive voice. Professional writers need to graduate from the idea that passive voice is wrong and that they'll invariably improve a sentence by making it active. This is another case of working on auto-pilot, and I've seen some horror-show cases. Here are just a few. I've mad-libbed the nouns to avoid someone tracing these back to the source ...

This is one of those topics that I feel I must throw some authoritative weight behind, because if you just Google "active voice versus passive voice" you'll find the same simplistic arguments and contrived examples, ad nauseam. [link to article ]. The article gives shocking examples of how even well-respected writing authorities have misdiagnosed the issue.  

But forget language authorities and just stop and think about it. Passive voice is sometimes the best choice. Consider this sentence:

The president was assassinated.

How would you rewrite it into active voice?

[Subject] assassinated the president.

Replace [Subject] with "Someone" or "A gunman" or "John." Is the sentence better? It depends. When you make the subject of the sentence the assassin, you shift the focus from the victim to the perpetrator. If this was your intention, then it's a good edit. But I think most people would argue that, in this case, the identity of the victim is more important. Most people wouldn't register anything linguistically wrong with the first sentence. That's because passive voice has a rightful place in English. You shouldn't need a language authority to convince you of that. Just pick up any well-regarded piece of writing and read carefully. You will find instances of passive voice.  

**When it comes to document creation, we are the subject matter experts:** I have had to push back on this practice of mangling sentences in an attempt to correct them and have been met with resistance. Particularly the argument that the customer wants active voice. OK, but I assume the customer also wants their document to make sense, be factually accurate, and sound good. And does the customer really understand what active voice even is? As the hired experts, it's our job to look beyond what the customer is literally asking for and see what they actually want. Usually that is a well-written, convincing document that expertly addresses the topic at hand using concise language written for the intended audience. They just don't always know how to ask for that in those particular words. So they fall back on what they learned in school (e.g., passive voice is wrong). As professional writers, it can fall on us to (gently and tactfully) remind others we are the experts on document generation. Editors have a harder time with this than most, I think. People take their writing personally and can feel personally insulted when an editor comes in and changes their work. I've had to sooth engineers who took offense because I did more than just fix their misspellings and commas. I've had to tell them it's OK, don't worry, I've seen much worse... you're the expert on the content, please let me be the expert on the writing... etc. There's also this attitude among educated people that they should be good writers because they went to school and are intelligent people. Fixing their writing is tantamount to telling them they're stupid, it would seem. But as I remind people often, it's very difficult for us to spot the shortcomings in our own writing because we're so close to the subject matter and have it all organized perfectly in our heads ... Writing is a truly difficult skill to master. I know I have a long way to go before I can consider myself having mastered it. Many years into this, and I'm still growing.

**Artificial intelligence cannot replace a seasoned technical writer ... (yet?).** I have a lot to say about generative AI and its role in document generation. I will leave most of those thoughts for a future post. For now I'll just mention that technical writers should learn to use AI and will need to if they wish to remain competitive. LLMs are a great tool for automating routine tasks, suggesting edits, and catching typos. Like many other roles, the role of tech writer is largely going to morph into AI interfacer. Yes, you can get AI to write an entire article free of typos and with a veneer of authority. But if you look closely, you'll notice the document is riddled with cliches, redundancies, vague half-truths, and outright hallucinations. The output still requires substantial rework by a skilled editor if it is going to be ...  My biggest concern is the factual inaccuracy that can creep in unnoticed by the editor. This actually happened to me recently, where I know the SMEs had used AI to write the draft, and I was able to spot of few factual mistakes, but I doubt I caught them all because I lack the domain knowledge. Really, this is isn't my battle. Companies will figure out the shortcomings if they haven't already and will have to implement company policies for its use.
